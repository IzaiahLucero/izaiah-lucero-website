<h1>Content Plan</h1>
<p>I want to build a website that updates the content dynamiclly as the user scrools so that it creates a timlapse of a project followed by a gallery of past projects.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 1</h2>
<h3>bio</h3>
<p>Name, current city and state, and a paragraph where I introduce myself.</p>
<h3>Contact Info</h3>
<p>This section will contain all of my contact info including email, phone number, social media accounts, etc.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 2</h2>
<h3>introduction</h3>
<p>In this section of the site, I want to explain how the site was designed and what I hope to accomplish with it.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 3</h2>
<h3>process</h3>
<p>In this section i want to break down the development process that I go through. It will start with the intake so what the customer tells me they want, then my concept for the application, finally the prototype showing features and functionaity, then moving into the testing of a phase 1 program, following by an implementation pan. This section will have dynamic images and text that update as the user scrolls.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 4</h2>
<h3>projects</h3>
<p>For the gallery I wanna to use a pin board style. And when the user clicks on one of the screenshots in the gallery it will open that project. Then in the project focus screen the user will be able to see three key peices of data. The clients request, the completed program description, and the skills utilized in the development of the applicaiton</p>
