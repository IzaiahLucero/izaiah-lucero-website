<h1>Content Plan</h1>
<p>I want to build the site utilizing a modular design. With content and sections have clear breaks. This concept will be present in the below content breakout. </p>
<br>

<h2>Section 1</h2>
<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Name, current city and state, and a paragraph where I introduce myself.</p>
<h3>Contact Info</h3>
<p>This section will contain all of my contact info including email, phone number, social media accounts, etc.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 2</h2>
<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
<p>In this section I will utilize the list of soft skills that I have that Esteban Martinez has told us to make sure we highlight for future employers. I'm going to develop icons for each soft skill so that I can then use that icon in my gallery and assign the 3 main skills required to complete each of my projects.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 3</h2>
<h3>Hard Skills</h3>
<p>In this section I will utilize the list of hard skills that I've obtained over the course of my work history. Similiar to my soft skills section I wanna develop corresponding icons that I can then assign to the projects completed in my gallery and highligh how those skills were used on that project.</p>
<br>

<h2>Section 4</h2>
<h3>Gallery</h3>
<p>This section will be a gallery that highlights all of my projects. With each project identify the skills required to complete that job/task.</p>
