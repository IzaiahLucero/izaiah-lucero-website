    <h1>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This website will serve as my personal portfolio to showcase all of my work with a focus on highlighting my skills. </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>My design for the site is based off of an intended audience of business professionals. The ideal target audience for my site will be small business owner professionals specifically. </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>My primary goal for the site is to create a story of how I address a company's needs and develop a solution for them. I wanna "walk" them through the process and show them that developing proprietary software for their company isn't out of reach. The secondary goal of my site is to display my work and continue to develop my online professional appearance.
