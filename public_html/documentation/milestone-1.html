    <h1>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This website will serve as my personal portfolio to showcase all of my work with a focus on highlighting my skills. </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>My design for the site is based off of an intended audience of business professionals. The ideal target audience for my site will be small business owner professionals specifically. </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>My primary goal for the site is to create a story of how I address a company's needs and develop a solution for them. I wanna "walk" them through the process and show them that developing proprietary software for their company isn't out of reach. The secondary goal of my site is to display my work and continue to develop my online professional appearance.

    <h1>Persona</h1>
    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>Kelly Rhinehart</p>

    <h2>Age</h2>
    <p>65</p>

    <h2>Profession</h2>
    <p>Kelly is the sole owner of Kelly Clean a local residential cleaning company that has seen a boom in business since the rise of Airbnb's. Kelly has a decent size staff with 5 crews of 5 girls. She handles all the business operations on a day to day basis now. She is the accountant, hiring manager, and everything in between. The client relationship manager that Kelly is using to run her business is outdated and has a very steep learning curve making it difficult for her to take a step back from the business. She is in the mark for a new CRM that will enable her to pass on the duty of creating schedules and managing client's accounts.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>iPhone 12, iMac 27-inch</p>

    <h2>Attitudes & Behaviors</h2>
    <p>Kelly has been running her small business for 40 years and is feeling the strain of the business as she gets older. She understands that she can't keep going at this pace for too much longer. Kelly knows the importance of task delegating but is worried that if she selects the wrong product then she will waste time migrating client information and it will put her behind. Kelly does not like wasting time but like to make sure that she fully understands something before making decisions when it comes to her business.</p>

    <h2>Frustrations & Needs</h2>
    <p>As Kelly gets older her personal life is becoming more and more time consuming and she finds she isn't able to dedicate as much time as she has in the past to her business. She finds that she is missing out on events with her family and its starting to weigh on her emotionally and mentally. She has attempted to purchase software in the past but found that it didn't meet her needs and the implementation required more time than she was able to give. She understands now that when she makes a decision she will need to dedicate an appropriate amount of time to doing the implementation and training.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>Kelly's only goal is to find a software solution that will minimize implementation time and address most if not all of her business and personal needs.</p>

    <h2>User Story</h2>
    <p>As a moderately tech-savvy individual I need to find a software solution that is easy to learn.</p>
